                  Hi!<span class="wave">üëã </span>
                  I'm Abhishek Tyagi, a 21-year-old engineering sophomore
                  pursuing BTech in Information Technology. I am a passionate
                  self-learner, Open source enthusiast, exploring and building
                  projectsüë®‚Äçüíª using various technologies. I am a frontend web
                  developer well versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and stand at a
                  beginner-intermediate level of React and Machine Learning.
                  Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom
                  Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of
                  coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I‚Äôve
                  had the privilege of building software for an advertising
                  agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product
                  studio. My main focus these days is building accessible user
                  interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo. I most enjoy building
                  software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet ‚Äî
                  things that look good but are also built well under the hood.
                  In my free time, I've also released an online video course
                  that covers everything you need to know to build a web app
                  with the Spotify API. When I‚Äôm not at the computer, I‚Äôm
                  usually rock climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and
                  two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for Korok seeds K
